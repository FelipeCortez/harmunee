Transforms your computer keyboard into a... keychord?

```
ASD  -> I, IV, V
ZXCV -> ii, iii, vi, vii
```
- Right arrow changes the base scale. Cycles between major, natural minor, harmonic minor and melodic minor scales
- Up/down arrows increase/decrease the key
- Pressing J adds 7ths to the chord
- IOP keys invert the chord (pressing any of those keys inverts once, pressing multiple keys simultaneously invert more)
